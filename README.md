# Predicting Credit Risk
**_Python_** and Machine Learning: Using pandas and **_Skikit-learn_** to predict Credit Risk

## Background
**Supervised Machine Learning and Predicting Credit Risk, evaluating several machine learning models to assess credit risk, using data from LendingClub; a peer-to-peer lending services company.

## Objectives
The goals of this challenge are:

- Implement machine learnin models
- Use Credit Risk **_Resampling Techniques_** to address class imbalance
- Evaluate the performance of machine learning models

# Using imabalanced-learn library to resample the data and build and evaluate logistic regression classifiers using the resampled data

Oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and **_SMOTE_** algorithms.
Undersample the data using the cluster centroids algorithm.
Use a combination approach with the **_SMOTEENN_** algorithm.
For each of the above you will find:

1. Train a logistic regression classifier (from **_Scikit-learn_**) using the resampled data.
2. Calculate the balanced accuracy score using balanced_accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics.
3. Generate a confusion_matrix.
4. Print the classification report (**_classification_report_imbalanced from imblearn.metrics_**).
